This is a repository for a web page that run a main.js javascript code. The code
 create a pyramid in the browser console. For that, please open your console to
see the result.

In the other hand, for Talan academy supervisors, I couldn't find a way to read
the pyramid height from the console. The readLine() function mentioned in the exercise isn't a predefined function. If I am not mistaken it is defined in node.js framework. As a solution I used the prompt method to read the pyramid height.
